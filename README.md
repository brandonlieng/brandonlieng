## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Toronto, working in the Montenegro Burke Lab and RÃ¶st Lab. My research interests revolve around answering biological questions by using different types of data. Some example types of data I've worked with recently include: liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data, [genetic interaction networks](https://thecellmap.org), and transcriptomics data from the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org).
