## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Toronto, working in the Montenegro Burke Lab and the RÃ¶st Lab. My research interests involve answering biological questions by integrating different modalities of data. Some examples of data that I've worked with recently include:

- Raw liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data
- Abundance matrices from untargeted metabolomics experiments
- [Global genetic interaction networks](https://thecellmap.org) generated by synthetic genetic arrays (SGA)
- Transcriptomics data from the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org)
