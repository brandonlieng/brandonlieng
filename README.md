## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Toronto, working in the Montenegro Burke Lab and RÃ¶st Lab. My research interests revolve around answering biological questions by combining different kinds of data. Some examples of types of data I've worked with recently include:

- Liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data
- [Global genetic interaction networks](https://thecellmap.org) generated by synthetic genetic arrays (SGA)
- Transcriptomics data from the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org)
